CircularCrownSelector is a selection menu that is controlled via Digital Crown.
The user interface is a replica of Apple's old Contact app designed for previous versions of watchOS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
This library is made to be used **only with watchOS**. Xcode dictates that a project must have an iOS project for a watchOS project to exist. So, please **ignore the folder `Example-iOS`** as it is an empty project.
